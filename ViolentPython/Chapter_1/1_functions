Strings: 

str() has the following function:

upper() | lower() | replace() | find() 

Upper() converts a string to its uppercase variant. 
Lower() converts a string to its lowercase variant.
Replace(old,new) replaces the old occurrence of the substring old with the substring new. 
Find() reports the offset where the first occurrence of the substring occurs.

Dictionaries

- The dictionary consists of pairs of items that contain a key and value.
- When constructing a dictionary, each key is separated from its value by a colon,
and we separate items by commas.

methods:
.keys()       will return a list of all keys in the dictionary and that the method
.items()      will return an entire list of items in the dictionary
.values() 
(nameOfDict['nameOfKey'])

Networking 

After importing the
socket module, we instantiate a new variable s from the class socket class. Next,
we use the connect() method to make a network connection to the IP address
and port. Once successfully connected, we can read and write from the socket
